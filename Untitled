I have downloaded a full static website using HTTrack.
All pages and features are currently working, but the codebase is messy, duplicated, and poorly structured.

I want you to refactor this project like a senior frontend architect.

🎯 Primary Goals

Clean, scalable, production-ready folder structure.

Remove redundancy and duplicate assets.

Improve maintainability and readability.

Preserve 100% functionality and design.

Prepare it for future scaling or migration (React / Next.js / CMS ready).

🏗 Step 1: Audit Phase

Analyze all HTML, CSS, JS, images, fonts, and external dependencies.

Detect:

Duplicate CSS/JS files

Unused assets

Inline styles/scripts

Repeated code across pages

Hardcoded paths

Provide a short technical audit summary before restructuring.

📁 Step 2: Professional Folder Structure

Refactor into this structure (or improve if needed):

/root
  /assets
    /css
    /js
    /images
    /fonts
    /icons
  /pages
  /partials (header, footer, reusable sections)
  index.html

Rules:

Centralize global styles into main.css

Separate vendor CSS/JS from custom files

Create modular JS files (navigation.js, slider.js, form.js, etc.)

Use relative clean paths

🧠 Step 3: Code Quality Improvements
HTML

Use semantic tags (header, section, article, nav, footer)

Remove unnecessary div wrappers

Improve indentation & formatting

Ensure accessibility (alt tags, labels, aria attributes)

CSS

Remove unused CSS rules

Group related styles

Use consistent naming (BEM methodology preferred)

Remove duplicate selectors

Extract inline styles into CSS files

JavaScript

Remove unused scripts

Modularize logic

Avoid global variables

Wrap scripts in IIFE or modules

Improve readability and comments

⚡ Step 4: Performance Optimization

Optimize image folder structure

Suggest image compression improvements

Minify CSS/JS (keep original readable version)

Remove render-blocking resources if possible

Improve loading order (defer, async)

🔗 Step 5: Internal Linking & Path Refactor

Fix all asset paths after restructuring

Ensure all navigation links work

Ensure forms and scripts function correctly

Validate console has zero errors

📊 Step 6: Output Required

After refactor:

Show final folder structure

Provide list of:

Removed files

Merged files

Optimizations done

Mention performance improvements

Confirm all features still work

🚫 Strict Rules

Do NOT change UI/UX

Do NOT remove required scripts

Do NOT modify business logic

Preserve SEO meta tags

Keep responsiveness intact
